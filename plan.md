The application will provide functionalities to add, view, search, update, and delete contacts. Additionally, it will feature a user-friendly interface for easy interaction.

## Features

1. **Contact Information Storage**: Store name, phone number, email, and address for each contact.
2. **Add Contact**: Allow users to add new contacts with their details.
3. **View Contact List**: Display a list of all saved contacts with names and phone numbers.
4. **Search Contact**: Implement a search function to find contacts by name or phone number.
5. **Update Contact**: Enable users to update contact details.
6. **Delete Contact**: Provide an option to delete a contact.
7. **User Interface**: Design a user-friendly interface for easy interaction.

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Project Setup

- Create a new project directory for the Contact Book application.
- Initialize a Git repository for version control.
- Set up the directory structure:
  ```
  contact-book/
  ├── src/                 # Source code directory
  ├── data/                # Directory to store contact data
  ├── tests/               # Directory for testing files
  ├── README.md            # Project documentation
  ├── plan.md              # Implementation plan (this file)
  ├── requirements.txt     # Dependencies
  ```

### Step 2: Data Model

- Define the structure of the contact data:
  - Name (String)
  - Phone Number (String)
  - Email (String)
  - Address (String)

### Step 3: Implement Functionality

- Create modules for each functionality:
  - **add_contact.py**: Add new contacts.
  - **view_contacts.py**: Display a list of contacts.
  - **search_contact.py**: Search for contacts by name or phone number.
  - **update_contact.py**: Update existing contact details.
  - **delete_contact.py**: Delete contacts from the list.
- Implement functions/classes within each module to perform the specified actions.

### Step 4: User Interface

- Choose a suitable UI framework (e.g., Tkinter, PyQt, Flask for web interface).
- Design the user interface layout:
  - Add Contact Form
  - Contact List Display
  - Search Functionality
  - Update/Delete Options
- Implement UI components and connect them to the corresponding functionality.

### Step 5: Testing

- Write unit tests for each module to ensure functionality.
- Test the application with various scenarios:
  - Adding new contacts
  - Viewing contact list
  - Searching for contacts
  - Updating contact details
  - Deleting contacts

### Step 6: Documentation and Finalization

- Write comprehensive documentation:
  - README.md: Project overview, installation instructions, usage guide, etc.
  - Plan.md: Implementation plan (this file).
- Ensure code readability and documentation within the codebase.
- Perform a code review and make necessary revisions.
- Finalize the project for deployment.

## Conclusion

By following this implementation plan, the Contact Book application will be developed with all the specified features, providing users with a convenient way to manage their contacts efficiently.
